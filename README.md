# study_R

This repo is for my personal use. As I try to learn and experiment multiple packages at once in seperate rprojects, my study folder got cluttered. So I figured I can use one project for things I have just started to learn. Generally I tend to follow package instructions or vignettes and this project is specifically for that stuff. If my usage of the specific package expands further -i.e. doing my own analysis with my own data or an individual project-, I will then create a seperate repo for that project.
